### Global-continuous-tool-path-with-controllable-local-direction
## Algorithm for generating global continuous tool-path with controllable deposition direction. Our code has two parallel main processes  
# 1.generate the gloabl continous toolpath with controllable deposition direction:
Input the mesh model into the slicer to generate 2D connected region. A 2D connected region is saved as seperate inner and outer contours. Our slicer refernces the paper "An Optimal Algorithm for 3D Triangle Mesh Slicing" .
