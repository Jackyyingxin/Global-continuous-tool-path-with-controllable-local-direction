## Global-continuous-tool-path-with-controllable-local-direction
#Algorithm for generating global continuous tool-path with controllable deposition direction.  
Input the mesh model into the slicer to generate 2D connected region. A 2D connected region is divided into discrete inner and outer contours. Our slicer refernces the paper "An Optimal Algorithm for 3D Triangle Mesh Slicing" .
