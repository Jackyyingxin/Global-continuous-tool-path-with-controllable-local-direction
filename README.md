### Global-continuous-tool-path-with-controllable-local-direction
##  Our code consists of four main modules. At first, you need to input the mesh model into the slicer to generate 2D connected region. A 2D connected region is saved as seperate inner and outer contours. Our slicer refernces the paper "An Optimal Algorithm for 3D Triangle Mesh Slicing" .
